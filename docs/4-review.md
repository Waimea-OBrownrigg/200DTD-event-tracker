# Project Review

## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Functionality

I made sure that all of the pages were accessible and that all the database actions worked.


### Useability

I made sure that everything was in the most convenient place that also made sense, and made sure that completing actions would redirect you to the most convenient place.


### Aesthetics 

I tried to make sure that everything was laid out nicely and clearly, and avoided making pages too cluttered.

## Overall Review

Overall, my website works well, but I had to cut some of the more complex features, due to time constraints, but testing helped me to refine experience of going from page to page.
