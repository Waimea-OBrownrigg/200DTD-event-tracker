# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

My parents want to keep track of when people are going out, have scheduled appointments, and other such things, to make organizing things easier.


## End-User Requirements

My parents something easy to use, that lets them add and remove events, and then shows them when those events are coming up.


## Proposed Solution

I will create a website that will have a list of events organized by date, a form to add more, and a button to remove them.
