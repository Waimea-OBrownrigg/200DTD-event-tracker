## Project Description

My project will be an event tracker for a group of people, a website where you can write down various upcoming events, and assign them to various people in the group, and it will display them in order based on which is the closest.

- Displays a list of all the events in order of date, from closest to farthest away.
- The list tells you who is involved, an the time and date of the event.
- Displays a list of all the people.
- Gives you the ability to add, edit, and remove events and people.
- When clicking on an event or person, it will show you detailed information about it.

## Project Details

This is a digital media and database project for **NCEA Level 2**, assessed against standards [91892](docs/as91892.pdf) and [91893](docs/as91892.pdf).

The project is a web app that uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) for the server back-end, connecting to a SQLite database. The final deployment of the app is on [Render](https://render.com/), with the database hosted at [Turso](https://turso.tech/).

The app uses [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/templates/) templating for structuring pages and data, and [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) as the starting point for styling the web front-end.

The project demonstrates a number of **advanced database techniques**:
- Linking data in related tables or nodes using queries or keys
- Writing custom queries to filter and/or sort data
- Using logical, mathematical and/or wildcard operators
- Customising presentation of the data
- Using custom forms to add user input to the database
- Setting validation rules for data entry

The project demonstrates a number of **advanced digital media (web) techniques**:
- Creating or customising scripts, code or presets
- Using a combination of steps to manipulate or enhance elements
- Using a third-party library
- Using composite effects
